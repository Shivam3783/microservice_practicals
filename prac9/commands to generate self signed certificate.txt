openssl genrsa -out key.pem
openssl req -new -key key.pem -out csr.pem
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in csr.pem -signkey key.pem -out cert.pem




explanation:

1. The openssl genrsa command is used to generate an RSA private key. RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a widely used asymmetric encryption algorithm that involves the use of a pair of keys: a private key for encryption and a corresponding public key for decryption. The genrsa command is used to generate the private key part of this pair.

2. The openssl req command is used for various operations related to certificate signing requests (CSRs) and certificates. In your provided command, you are creating a new CSR (Certificate Signing Request) using an existing private key. 

3. The openssl x509 command is used for working with X.509 certificates in OpenSSL. In your provided command, you are using it to sign a certificate signing request (CSR) and create a self-signed certificate.
